# AdvancedMath

AdvancedMath is a Java-based application designed to perform advanced mathematical calculations, including calculus, number conversions, and programmer-specific operations.

## Features

- **Number Formatting**: Convert numbers between different bases (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal) using classes like [`Binary`](src/main/java/com/amath/advacedmath/programmer/Binary.java) and [`BaseN`](src/main/java/com/amath/advacedmath/programmer/BaseN.java).
- **Bit Range Operations**: Define and manipulate bit ranges with the [`BitRange`](src/main/java/com/amath/advacedmath/programmer/BitRange.java) class.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Perform advanced calculations using classes like [`_Function_`](src/main/java/com/amath/advacedmath/calculate/equation/_Function_.java) and [`NewtonRamphsonMethod`](src/main/java/com/amath/advacedmath/calculate/equation/NewtonRamphsonMethod.java).
- **Base Conversions**: Handle conversions between various number bases with the [`Base`](src/main/java/com/amath/advacedmath/programmer/Base.java) enum.
- **Custom Calculations**: Extendable framework for implementing custom mathematical operations.

## Requirements

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven for dependency management and building the project
